  "question": "Alice likes all the numbers which are divisible by AA. Bob does not like the numbers which are divisible by BB and likes all the remaining numbers. Determine the smallest number greater than or equal to NN which is liked by both Alice and Bob. Output -1 if no such number exists.",

    "The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.",
